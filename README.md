Commands
--------
This package includes two commands to run Lisp code in Emacs from Atom:

* `language-emacs-lisp:run-selection`
* `language-emacs-lisp:run-file`

These aren't attached to any keybindings by default. You'll need to assign them
[shortcuts](http://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/keymaps-in-depth/)
yourself.

**NOTE:**
These require Emacs to be in your `$PATH`, and probably don't work on Windows.
